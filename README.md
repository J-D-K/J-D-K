#### About Me:
* Started learning C/C++ many years ago as a teenager to write PSP homebrew. 
* Have been programming on and off for years when I have time.
* Still learning new things all of the time.
* Created the first homebrew save data manager that could be installed on 3DS and didn't require users to memorize/match title ID numbers.
* Created the first public overclocking tool for Switch.
* Created the first homebrew tool to add custom avatars to Switch profiles.
* Created a **private** auction sniper for Great Collections (written in C) that can bid in an auction down to the literal final second.
* Currently working on rewriting JKSV, the Switch version of my save data manager.
